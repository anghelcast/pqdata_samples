Hello there

The following series of notebooks are just a simple sketch for power quality analysis based on real field measurements.

Power quality analyzer used for measurements: CIRCUTOR MYEBOX 1500

Electrical parameters were evaluated according to Mexican "MANUAL REGULATORIO DE REQUERIMIENTOS TÉCNICOS PARA LA CONEXIÓN DE CENTROS DE
CARGA" a.k.a. grid code v 2.0

Hope you find this info useful
